      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h3>Questions & Answers</h3>
    <p>Q1:How React works?</p><br>
    <p>Ans:We all know we can creat React components using JSX and then render them on the web using DOM or in a mobile
      app using react Native.React is a UI development library which is JavaScript based.When we call the component ,we
      get the real return value.First,the JSX gets converted to many React.creat element function calls.Then,each of
      them returns the appropriate object.In our case ,it is object that represents the root element,a div.</p><br>
    <p>Q2:What are the difference between 'props' and 'state'?</p><br>
    <p>Ans:Both the Props and State do similar things but we use them in different ways.
      Props is the abbreviation for properties and are used to pass data between React components in a uni directional
      way only which is form perent to child only and between the siblings.
      State which is another special build-in object ,allows components to creat and manage them own data.So ,unlike
      props ,components cannot pass data with State,but they can creat and manage it internally.
